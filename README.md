The `getGithubUserIds()` function retrieves the list of Github Ids of users who have starred a given repositroy.

To test the usage, clone the project to a directory. Change the `repository` in `main.bal` to any github repository. Run `bal run` command. A `stargazers.json` file with the github ids of the users who have starred the repo will get created in the current directory.
